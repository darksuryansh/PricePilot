These have been 2 years of extreme , rigorous and very very careless usage and these earphones are still in prime condition, needless to add I'm an avid consumer of music ,l wear my earbuds almost all day long , I've worn them in the gym , while running , they've seen a lot of sweat , a lot of earwax , most of the days ,i fall asleep while wearing them and get up with them either under them or on the floor, I've been very very merciless with these earbuds , I have not used them ,I have exploited them, after allll of this ,  they're still in prime condition, the mic on these works extremely well, they charge pretty quickly , the box takes a little longer to get fully charged but it lasts for a long time , call quality, voice quality , everything is awesome , their response to your touch is also very durable and awesome , it happens ever so oftent that I'm in the gym and my phone is drenched in sweat and it's screen starts malfunctioning and as a result I can't take calls , but thanks to these earphones , even after all the sweat and moisture they respond to my touch instantly amd I'm able to take calls , in the gym, while driving, 2 wheelers , 4 wheelers , everything...you know I lost their charging box somewhere , so I purchased another set of the same earphones just for the box and im still using the old earbuds with the new box , I have dropped them quite roughly several times , one or two times I have thrown them away because I was angry due to some reason and they're still going one without an ounce of reduction in quality ,  this is why I'm calling them marvellous... After such rough and extreme usage , i just can't find any big noticable flaw in them.... But yes , I'll like to add that everything depreciates with time , after 2 years of usage , their batter life isn't as good as when they were new , but the sound quality ,the durability, it's still 90% of how it was when they were new...There may be some people who are extra extra critical and would say they give 4.6 to music , 3. Blah blah blah to sound , to bass , don't bother listening to nerds and wannabe tech gurus , go for it , best in class , marvel of engineering , this is gonna be one of those few purchases that youre gonna be proud of , over and out...

Under this price this is the best basic tws available, which is durable and with no issues like in other companies' similar range products(boat, realme, noise, etc etc), such as the case battery doesn't charge or the ear pods don't charge or the pin doesn't connect. I have seen other people around me with other tws, failing after 1year or within 1 year. Just one issue, with several connected devices around, the pods sometimes don't connect. Solution is to put the pods in the case and plug it to the charger once for few seconds. It gets recalibrated. I didn't drop the ear pods much, maybe once or twice. And always charge with a normal charger, not a fast charger. It takes at around 2 hours, but even with 2-3+ hours of calls/playback everyday, it goes 5days - 1 week with 1 charge. And I use it daily. Can also be used as single ear pods, but the microphone quality drops, understandingly. The fit is fine. Won't drop off easily. The touch controls does what they are supposed to. I keep it very basic, just forward/stop/stop/answer/cut calls. Within these, it works fine. Within this price range, ( 1600 ) the sound is very decent and as expected. It won't blow your mind, but you won't feel any difference in your day to day usage. Range is also decent. No ANC. Was not looking for one. Overall, very good basic tws. 👍🏽 Read more", "author": "Arka D.", "date": "Reviewed in India on 28 October 2025", "helpful_count": "6 people found this helpful", "verified_purchase": true}, {"title": "The Budget Battery Beast with quality sound output.", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "text": "One of the most striking aspects of the Nord Buds 3r is the design and build quality, especially the premium matte finish. This choice of material lends a sleek, non-glossy, and sophisticated feel that elevates the earbuds well beyond their price tag. For the price, the sound quality is genuinely impressive. The sound profile is distinctly bass-heavy. However, it's worth noting that at higher volume levels, the sound fidelity can suffer, the punchiness can give way to distortion, making it difficult to feel all the beats clearly. The battery performance is nothing short of amazing. The capacity of both the buds and the charging case allows for near week-long usage without needing to search for an outlets.

It fits comfortably and can be used during physical exercise. Excellent battery life atleast for now. I charge once for two weeks after using daily for 2 hours. Also no connectivity issues faced. Very durable. The features to control settings of earphones with heymelody app is nice. If only they could allow us tonset long press for voice assistant it would be perfect. But during a call it's difficult for people listening to you to hear clearly, especially in crowded places. It might be good enough if you speak loudly but that's weird in public.
